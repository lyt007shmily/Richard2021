1st question, do people notice "you can't move the file when it's opened in windows"
         but, you can "move file while it's open or editing in Mac OS". 
         
Why? 
So for windows, they use FAT filesystem. FAT store data directly in the directory entry including file's loacation. 
Opening a file means reading the directory entry itself into memroy and updating it when editing the file. 
However, that means there is one directory entry per file and you cannot delete(or move) the file while it's open. 

For Mac OS, the system maintains several references to the inode, which contain the meta-information about the fie.
As long as there are references, the inode and file's data are kept.(kept where?) 
That means, when move a file within the same device, a new directory entry is created in the destination directory,
and original directory entry is removed. 

In case of power fail or system shutdown, the disk will perform a FSCK(file system check). Sometime the on-disk
inode and directory structure can be recovered and file will remain in the directory or in the lost+found directory.
