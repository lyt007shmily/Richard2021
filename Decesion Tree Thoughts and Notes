1-What is Decision Tree?
Decision tree is a tree-like upside-down flow chart~ (root on top, branch, and leaf in the bottom)
The main purpose of decision tree is to help find important feature of the data and make calculated decisions~
Each branch and leaf is using recursive partitioning method on the basis of attribute value! 

2-What is the structure and symbal meaning in Decision Treeï¼Ÿ
Decision tree contains internal node for attribute, root node, branch and leaf for decision.

3-Creating decision tree process? 
1st, we need to devide data into training set and testing set, usually is 30/70 or 20/80.
2nd, we use ASM to create decision tree based on training data. 
3rd, we use testing data to test our model.
4th, we will use performance evaluation matrix such as accuracy, precision, and recall to adjust the model. 

4-How does "spliting Process" work? 
The spliting, also called Attribute Selection Measures, will partition data into best possible manner. 
ASM, the spliting process, will create a rank for each feature with a score. 
Each branch will contain information gain, gain ratio(size), Gini index.
